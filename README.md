# Sporallis

Convert Spore saves <-> Stellaris saves.

This utility is made to convert Spore space stage maps into Stellaris
savegames, which can then be continued. While Spore is an amazing game,
Stellaris captures the prospect of a space-faring civilization better. So, why
not have the best of both worlds?

# Requirements and Dependencies

These conversion tools depend on Lua 5.1 (LuaJIT >2 is **extremely**
recommended), [LPEG](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/), and
[inspect.lua](https://github.com/kikito/inspect.lua), all of which are available
through [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/).
